Test::Snapshots allows you to test any executable without
caring what languages it has been written in.
It only cares about what it prints to the standard output 
and error.

The module integrates well with the Test::Simple/Test::More world
as it is using Test::Builder as a back-end.

Installation:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
